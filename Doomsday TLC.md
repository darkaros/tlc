<i>Version 2: Updated 12.11.2018</i>
<p>Hi all! I’m darkaros. As you know, Doomsday event is happening and it will lasts for <strong>45</strong> days. We need a proper plan for everyone in order to <strong>getting stronger together</strong>.<br>
For more details, you could check on other sources or in the help menu of this game. But now, I’ll keep it to be more clear and simple as much as possible.</p>
<h2 id="quick-introduction">Quick introduction</h2>
<p>4 main things are already shown in Doomsday conquest screen.</p>
<ol>
<li>Season: Current our alliance ranking across all states</li>
<li>Territory: Show all your occupied territories and your current <strong>Influence Value</strong>. For this phase, you must earn <strong>Influence Value</strong> as many as possible. Your ranking will also give you some money.</li>
<li>Honor Structures: It has 4 types of building. For each one, you could build maximum 4 buildings. Summary, you could build 16 tiny buildings. (I’ll explain in <strong>Specialty</strong> section).<br>
2 most important buildings are <strong>Virus Research Facility</strong> and <strong>Processing Plant.</strong><br>
<strong>Virus Research Facility</strong> give you <strong>infection immunity</strong>, which reduces <strong>poisoned troops</strong> when you occupying territory. Basically, if you want to occupy high level territory, you must upgrade this.<br> My recommendation is focus on these 2 building at the moment. <br>
<strong>Processing Plant</strong> product <em><strong>Virus Sample</strong></em> and <strong>Composite materials</strong>. Higher level of this building, more productivity (production speed) you will get.<br>
<em><strong>Virus Sample</strong></em> for upgrading <strong>Virus Research Facility</strong> and <strong>Composite materials</strong> for upgrading <strong>Processing Plant</strong></li>
<li>Specialty: 2 main things here are Specialty level and Schematic.<br>
When you level up here, you will get 1 specialty point. Use this point to 3 types of schematic: GREEN, BLUE and RED.<br>
For more details, you could click on any schematic and see its abilities.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="current-phase-plan">Current phase plan</h2>
<p><strong>For this phase</strong>, you should spend your Specialty points on <strong>Construction Master</strong> of <strong>BLUE</strong> schematic. Why? It increase the Honor Structure capacity, that means you could build more tiny yellow, green building on the map (<strong>Virus Research Facility</strong> and <strong>Processing Plan</strong>).<br>
Construction Master is place at 4 corners of BLUE schematic: Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest. Just spending you points in there.<br>
In case you spend it in too many wrong places, you could use <em>reset item</em>. But please save it if possible. Because in near future, after get all 4 tiny building, you have to reset and spending points on other schematic, such as RED one.</p>
<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>When could I attack high level territory?</b><br>
Basically, if it says some red message : bla bla bla, it means your immunity is below the territory’s influence value. But you still able to attack if Suffer is less than 20. Be careful that could cost 70% power of your troops. Less than 10 is safe to attack.<br>
The green message means you could attack without being poisoned. But that’s quite boring, you need more challenge.<br>
I recommend to attack <strong>few territories with suffer less than 20</strong> and attack <strong>all the territories with suffer less than 10</strong>.</li>
<li><b>Plan for occupying:</b><br>
Ideally you should keep in maximum 3 level of territory. This means if you are able to to occupy level 5, you should abandon all level 1 and 2, maybe 3 as well. So you will have only level 4 and level 5 territories.</li>
<li><b>How could I increase the Inflection Immunity to occupy high level territories?</b><br>
You need to build more Virus Research Facility. (check current phase plan). No matter how high of your Virus Research Facility, each level give you only 100 immunity value.<br>
For example: you need 1000 immunity value, upgrade 1 Virus Research Facility with level 10 is really costly but 2 Virus Research Facilities with level 5 is very easy.</li>
<li><b>How to reduce poisoned troops when occupying?</b><br>
Key point: <b>"Don't ever use all your power to attack a territory!"</b><br>
Basically, you can't occupy high level plot because your troops are poisoned not because it's weak. That means you should <b>send troops with enough power to defect</b> that plot, don't use all your power. More power you send, more poisoned you get. <br>So how do you determine how much power you need for a particular plot? By trying few times, you will get the answer. In my case, for level 7 plot with suffer less than 10%, I could win a fight with 17x power, normally i send 22x power only.
</li>
<li><b>Don't put all your poisoned troops into 8hours or 12hours hospital (Virus Research Facility)</b></li>
Unless you have a busy day. Normally, just put some with 1 or 2 hours or whenever you have time for occupying. Then after few hours, you have troops for occupying
